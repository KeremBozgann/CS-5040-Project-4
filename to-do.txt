Ask if we are allowed to use java List class "size()" method for
implementing "getNumberOfNeighbors()" method and "iterator()" 
method to implement "getNeighborIterator()" method of vertex. 

Ask if we can connect an edge with start and endVertex already 
connected by another edge with a different weight. 

Considering this is an undirected graph, "connect" method
of vertex class should add edge from endVertex to thisVertex 
as well as thisVertex to endVertex. I have implemented connect
methods this way.
